    <h1><center>About Me</center></h1>
    <p>
      I am a passionate engineering student with a keen interest in web development and emerging technologies. I have done my Secondary and Higher Secondary Education from Carmel High School. Currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology, from Heritage Institute of Technology. I enjoy building dynamic websites and interactive web applications.
      My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in programming, data structures, and software engineering. Outside the classroom, I dedicate time to building personal projects and exploring new frameworks and tools, which helps me deepen my understanding and stay ahead in the fast-paced world of web development.
      I'm always excited to learn new tools, collaborate with others, and create innovative solutions that make a difference. Whether it's front-end design or back-end logic, I love turning ideas into real, functional applications.
